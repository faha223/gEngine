This is a readme file.

This project is an extension of the nuRenderer project which adds support for a quaternion based transformation stack, colors,
more shaders, and meshes (not animated ones yet). 

required libraries:
	libusb-1.0 (for steelBattalion controller support through libSteelBattalion. precompiled libSteelBattalion included in this project)
	libSDL-1.2
	
also required development and runtime libraries for OpenGL 3.3

To build:
	type:
		make x86
	or
		make x64
	depending on your platform. This may require modifying of the files depending on your operating system (library locations, header locations, etc.)

To run:
	build first.
	type:
		./driver32 
	or
		./driver64
	depending on your platform.


TODO:
	Add support for shadow mapping for each light in the scene (FBOs and cube depth maps for point lights, FBOs and 2D depth maps for directional and spotlights)
	The algorithm is as follows:
	1. Render all geometry for each VBO to the depth buffer of the FBO for the given lights' shadow map. Write to z-buffer only and NO ANISO
	2. Render the scene from the camera perspective passing the array of shadow maps to the fragment shader and checking against it to determine if a given light should light the pixel or not
